# standard-api/core

Welcome to the core repository of stapi.ai, our endeavor to revolutionize software design, development, and operation. Here, the "code as data" philosophy comes alive, enabling symbolic system definitions with an emphasis on business logic.

Stapi.ai core is gateway to a declarative, accessible, and AI-optimized software system. It's not a polished diamond yet, But a treasure chest of potential gems, awaiting exploration and refinement.
