The bedrock of our open-source initiative to transform the way we design, develop, and operate software systems.
Grounded in Domain-Driven Design, event modeling and microservices, stapi.ai core equips you to define your system's
business logic in a language that's intuitive, natural, and optimized for AI integrations.

It's not a polished diamond yet, But a treasure chest of potential gems, awaiting exploration and refinement.
