# standard-api/core

Welcome to the core repository of stapi.ai, an endeavor to (r)evolutionize software design, development, and operation.
Here, the "code as data" philosophy comes alive in the form of new, somewhat opinionated, and currently experimental
[domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), based on 
[known principles we like](https://docs.stapi.ai/principles). This enables symbolic system definitions with an 
emphasis on business logic.

Stapi.ai core is gateway to a declarative, accessible, and AI-optimized software system. 
It's not a polished diamond yet, But a treasure chest of potential gems, awaiting exploration and refinement.

Interested in knowing more? Dive into our [full documentation](https://docs.stapi.ai/) to understand how stapi.ai 
core may be used to build standalone API services, adapt to the AI landscape, and contribute to our journey towards 
hyperflexible systems and decentralized A(G)I.
